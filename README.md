# iris-data-set

Here are some key points from your project on the Iris dataset:

Project Overview: The project involves applying three different machine learning algorithms to the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset used for classification tasks.

Algorithms Used:

k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN): Achieved an accuracy of 1.0, indicating that it perfectly classified all the samples in the dataset.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Achieved an accuracy of 0.967, showing a high level of performance but slightly less than kNN.
Naive Bayes: Also achieved an accuracy of 0.967, matching the performance of the SVM algorithm.
Accuracy Comparison: The project highlights that different algorithms can yield different accuracy levels even on the same dataset. In this case, kNN outperformed both SVM and Naive Bayes, though the latter two had identical accuracies.

Dataset: The Iris dataset is used, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Conclusion: The project demonstrates the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms and emphasizes the importance of selecting the right algorithm for a given problem based on their performance metrics.
